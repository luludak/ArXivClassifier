Survey on Semantic Stereo Matching / Semantic Depth Estimation,"Stereo matching is one of the widely used techniques for inferring depth from
stereo images owing to its robustness and speed. It has become one of the major
topics of research since it finds its applications in autonomous driving,
robotic navigation, 3D reconstruction, and many other fields. Finding pixel
correspondences in non-textured, occluded and reflective areas is the major
challenge in stereo matching. Recent developments have shown that semantic cues
from image segmentation can be used to improve the results of stereo matching.
Many deep neural network architectures have been proposed to leverage the
advantages of semantic segmentation in stereo matching. This paper aims to give
a comparison among the state of art networks both in terms of accuracy and in
terms of speed which are of higher importance in real-time applications.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
FUTURE-AI: Guiding Principles and Consensus Recommendations for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in Future Medical Imaging,"The recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) combined with the
extensive amount of data generated by today's clinical systems, has led to the
development of imaging AI solutions across the whole value chain of medical
imaging, including image reconstruction, medical image segmentation,
image-based diagnosis and treatment planning. Notwithstanding the successes and
future potential of AI in medical imaging, many stakeholders are concerned of
the potential risks and ethical implications of imaging AI solutions, which are
perceived as complex, opaque, and difficult to comprehend, utilise, and trust
in critical clinical applications. Despite these concerns and risks, there are
currently no concrete guidelines and best practices for guiding future AI
developments in medical imaging towards increased trust, safety and adoption.
To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a careful selection of guiding
principles drawn from the accumulated experiences, consensus, and best
practices from five large European projects on AI in Health Imaging. These
guiding principles are named FUTURE-AI and its building blocks consist of (i)
Fairness, (ii) Universality, (iii) Traceability, (iv) Usability, (v) Robustness
and (vi) Explainability. In a step-by-step approach, these guidelines are
further translated into a framework of concrete recommendations for specifying,
developing, evaluating, and deploying technically, clinically and ethically
trustworthy AI solutions into clinical practice.","['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']"
